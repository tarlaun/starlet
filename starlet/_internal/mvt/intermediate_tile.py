"""Intermediate vector tile used by the map/reduce MVT pipeline.

Provides a small tile object that collects Web Mercator geometries,
retains a bounded uniform sample of them, merges with partial tiles from
other mappers, and simplifies the retained features into tile pixel
coordinates only when encoding MVT bytes.

Sampling is **raster-consistent and priority-based**. Every feature gets a
priority of ``(size in tile units, hash)`` — bigger first, the hash (by
default ``crc32`` of its WKB — geometry-intrinsic and deterministic; the
batch pipeline passes the crc32 of the *source* WKB bytes computed before
decode) as the tie-break. The ``feature_capacity`` highest-priority
features larger than one display pixel (``extent / PIXEL_GRID`` tile units
per side) are kept in full. *Every other* feature — sub-pixel ones and the
larger ones that did not make the cut — contributes a one-pixel *dot* to
the pixel cell of its bbox centre, one dot per cell (highest priority), so
the tile shows every occupied pixel, like a rasterised plot, and its biggest
shapes in detail, with a bounded number of features. Because the same
geometry has the same priority in every tile it touches, adjacent tiles
make consistent decisions — no seam popping — and merging partial tiles
from different mappers is a deterministic union.

Dots are encoded as a one-pixel square / segment of their own geometry type
(so they are styled like their full-size siblings) and carry no attributes —
they are looked up on demand.
