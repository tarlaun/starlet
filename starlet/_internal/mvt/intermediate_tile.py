"""Intermediate vector tile used by the map/reduce MVT pipeline.

Provides a small tile object that collects Web Mercator geometries,
retains a bounded uniform sample of them, merges with partial tiles from
other mappers, and simplifies the retained features into tile pixel
coordinates only when encoding MVT bytes.

Sampling is **priority-based top-k** rather than an independent random
reservoir: every feature carries a priority (by default ``crc32`` of its
WKB — geometry-intrinsic and deterministic; the batch pipeline passes the
crc32 of the *source* WKB bytes computed before decode), and each tile
keeps the ``feature_capacity`` features with the highest priority. Because
the same geometry has the same priority in every tile (and zoom level) it
touches, adjacent tiles make consistent keep/drop decisions — no seam
popping — and merging partial tiles from different mappers is a
deterministic top-k union instead of a statistical resample. Hash
priorities are uniformly distributed, so the retained set is still a
uniform sample of everything seen.
